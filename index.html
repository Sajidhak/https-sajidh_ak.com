    <p>
      I believe physics is not memorization — it is exploration. 
      My work focuses on inquiry-based STEM education, hands-on 
      experimentation, and science communication.

      <h2 class="insight-title">The Curse of Knowledge</h2>
      <p class="insight-text">
        While I was taking the edX course 𝘊𝘐𝘙𝘛𝘓𝘹: 𝘈𝘥𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘛𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘌𝘷𝘪𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦-𝘉𝘢𝘴𝘦𝘥 𝘚𝘛𝘌𝘔 𝘛𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, I came across a concept that struck me deeply: The Curse of Knowledge—the hidden challenge all teachers possess.

📖 Imagine this:
Mary👩‍🎓 and John👨‍🎓 are seated next to each other. John does not understand a concept and is perplexed. Mary, who has only recently discovered it, understands it—and explains it to him.

Here's the catch.
Mary would be more likely to explain and make John understand than the professor in class.

💭 Why?
Because she recently learned it and still knows the difficulties in the learning phase.The professor, however, learned it so long ago and the concept is so clear to him that he cannot even imagine somebody not understanding it. 

This cognitive disconnect is what Steven Pinker calls "The Curse of Knowledge."

It tells us something important:
Expertness tends to make us forget how it is to be new.
As educators, we need to slow down, zoom out, and teach as if our learners are encountering the concept for the first time.

Here’s what we can do:
🔹 Put yourself in the learner's shoes 👣
🔹 Break down ideas with patience 🧩
🔹 Ask: "When I first was taught this, what was confusing?" 🤔
🔹 Utilize peer instruction 👥 — since sometimes our students are better teachers of each other.

🗣️ Peer instruction is not a backup—it's a bridge.
It fosters relatability, identification with strife, and better understanding.

Let’s build learning experiences that connect, not just instruct. Let’s actively make space for peer explanation, shared struggle, and collective growth.

It’s time we break the Curse of Knowledge.
